## What is WorthMyHours?
WorthMyHours is a browser extension that converts price tags on websites into the equivalent amount of your working time. It helps you understand the true cost of purchases in terms of hours of your life spent earning that money.

### Manual Installation (Chrome/Edge)

1. Download or clone this repository to your computer
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top-right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files
5. The extension should now appear in your browser toolbar
6. Click the extension icon and enter your hourly wage in the settings

## Features

- **Real-time Price Conversion**: Automatically detects and converts prices on any website
- **Works Everywhere**: Compatible with most online shopping sites, including Amazon
- **Customizable Display**: Personalize colors and message text to your preferences
- **Privacy Focused**: All your wage information is stored locally on your device, never sent to any servers

## How It Works

1. Set your hourly wage in the extension popup
2. Browse the web normally
3. See price tags automatically appended with time cost information (e.g., "150rs â†’ 2.5 hrs of your life")
